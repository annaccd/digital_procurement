Thesis Title: A natural language processing approach to identifying and analysing digital technology procurement within the Brazilian Federal Government  

Abstract 

Digital transformation is crucial for enhancing transparency and efficiency in the public sector. Public procurement, as a further matter,  has the potential to drive the adoption of digital solutions and promote innovation. Despite being considered a leading nation in digital government (OECD, 2020), Brazil still faces challenges in analysing its digital technology procurement data. Leveraging this data can promote transparency and accountability, leading to effective procurement practices and further digitalisation strategies. The aim of this research is therefore to uncover patterns that have shaped the procurement of digital technologies in the Brazilian Federal Government over the past decade.

The approach chosen is to employ natural language processing techniques to reveal insights from the publicly available data on contracts performed by the federal government. The rationale behind this approach is that unstructured text data is used to describe the subjects of the contracts. After initial topic modelling and manual labelling of the data, a supervised machine learning model was employed to classify the contracts into public procurement categories. The classification allowed for further exploratory data analysis.

A total of 9,698 digital technology contracts were identified, accounting for 2.16% of the total contracts over the last decade. Surprisingly, investments in digital technology are not increasing over time, despite their growing importance worldwide. Adoption and investment levels vary greatly across government departments, highlighting the need for a more unified approach to public procurement of digital technologies. Additionally, a few suppliers dominate the market, emphasising the demand to rethink procurement processes to ensure competitiveness and innovation among vendors.
